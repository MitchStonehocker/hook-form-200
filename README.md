This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This uses React hooks exclusivly to achive maximum code seperation of functions by generation of custom hooks. These custom hooks are reusable across components in an app. The custom hooks (most of them I think) are generalized for immediate use in other apps. These hooks are:

- useStyles - (Material_UI themes and styles)
- useInput - manages:
  {
  props: {
  name,
  value,
  onChange: handleChange,
  onBlur: handleBlur,
  error
  },
  validate: handleValidate
  }
- useSubmit - manages:
  {
  props: {
  onSubmit: handleSubmit
  },
  errorItems
  }
- Regex validation of all input controls on a form
- Other 'utility' hooks:
  - useDater - displays the current date (to the day)
  - useMouse - displays the mouse position
  - useTimer - display the current time (to the second)
  - useWindow - displays the size of window

There is not global state maangement in this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
